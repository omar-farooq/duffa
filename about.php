<h2>Who we are</h2>
<p>We're Manchester's open Ultimate Frisbee club, one of the largest in the North West and organisers of DUFFA Hat. We meet and play twice a week - outdoors at Fog Lane Park, Didsbury, Manchester and indoors (winter only) at Parrs Wood High School Sports Hall.</p>

<p>Over the summer (April - August), we play every Thursday and Sunday and finish with a pint or three in the Fletcher Moss, Didsbury. Over the winter (September - April), we play every Sunday with a midweek session indoors.</p>

<p>Our players are of varying levels, from total beginners to uni-level. We also frequently meet up for socials in and around the Didsbury area.</p>

<p>DUFFA's aim is to ensure that new members are always made to feel welcome and level ensures that just about anyone can just turn up and join in. We welcome all abilities, especially those who have never played before. We're happy to take people new to Ultimate Frisbee through the basics - from how to throw and catch and go over the rules in a relaxed atmosphere.  We run regular "Beginners Sessions" but if you're interested in trying Ultimate feel free to turn up to any session in old trainers (or ideally football boots, especially if it's muddy) and bring a bottle of water. 
</p>
<p>Beginners are ALWAYS welcome and we also run beginners specific session on the first Sunday of every month - see here for more details.
</p>
<p>For players looking for something more serious than pickup (you can still come to DUFFA too!) then there is a new website - Ultimate Frisbee in Manchester - providing details of every club in Manchester.
